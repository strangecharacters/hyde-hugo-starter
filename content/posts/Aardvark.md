Have you got an idea for a game that you's love to make. Have you been dreaming about it ever since you got your first computer?

Programming a game isn't easy, right?

Here's the good news. There are a lot of great resources and tutorials available nowadays.
 
I'm learning how to code in Unity and I'm taking all of you with me!

If i was a diligent student I would start at the beginning and just work through lessons like a machine. But to be honest I'm terrible at studying. I want to find tutorials and lessons that I'm excited to work through. 
I want to see a way to implement things from my favourite games. 

I want to be inspired by things that could go into a dream game I haven't even created yet.

Finding the cool stuff and sharing it here is what CodeCenery is all about.

#### Line Of Sight - Sebastian Lague
A twin stick shooter movement with a beam of light effect created by generating a mesh on the fly and applying a basic shader.
You might have seen similar in Monaco and Teleglitch.
This is one of my favourite tutorials - some simple techiniques but introducing some intermediate to advanced things as well. Sebastian explains things in detail, shows every line of code and produces a cool looking effect at the end of it all.

Tested in Unity 20Something

#### Ink Unity Integration
I loved playing 80 days on mobile and was eager to try and see how it was made.
Inkle is a tool for making text based games. This tutorial shows how to integrate Ink into Unity. This allows you to leverage a great piece of exisiting software and add your own unique Unity spin to the display of your story.

#### Invaders from Outer Space
From the first line of code to publishing on the Play Store this covers everything.
A realtively simple game of space invaders but covered in complete detail. If youve got too many half complete projects this might be the one for you. 
Sprites, player and enemy movement, collisions, sound, menus and publishing. I often neglect the polish when I'm trying out different game ideas, this is a great example of completing things.
The assets, sounds and fonts used are all provided. Great quality tutorial.
